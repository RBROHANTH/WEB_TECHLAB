                    <h2>About Our Native Roosters and Hens</h2>
                    <p>The native breeds of Tamil Nadu, such as Aseel and Kadaknath, are known for their resilience and adaptability. These hardy birds thrive in free-range environments, offering superior meat quality and excellent disease resistance. With their strong body structure and vibrant plumage, they are well-suited for backyard farming and sustainable poultry production.</p>
                    <p>Our birds are raised in a natural setting, ensuring they remain healthy and active. They are fed a balanced diet, including grains and natural forages, contributing to their rich nutritional profile and superior taste.</p>

                    <h2>Our Farming Practices</h2>
                    <p>At RBR Farms, we follow traditional and eco-friendly poultry farming practices. Our birds are raised in a free-range environment, allowing them to forage naturally and grow without the use of artificial growth enhancers or antibiotics.</p>
                    <p>We also preserve indigenous farming techniques, such as natural brooding and rotational grazing, ensuring our poultry remain strong and disease-resistant. Our commitment to ethical and sustainable farming ensures that our products are not only healthy but also sustainably produced. By allowing our birds to roam freely and forage naturally, we enhance their overall well-being while maintaining ecological balance.</p>
