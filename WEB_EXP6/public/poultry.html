                            <p>The native breeds of Tamil Nadu, such as Aseel and Kadaknath, are known for their resilience and adaptability. These hardy birds thrive in free-range environments, offering superior meat quality and excellent disease resistance. With their strong body structure and vibrant plumage, they are well-suited for backyard farming and sustainable poultry production.</p>
                            <p>Our birds are raised in a natural setting, ensuring they remain healthy and active. They are fed a balanced diet, including grains and natural forages, contributing to their rich nutritional profile and superior taste.</p>
