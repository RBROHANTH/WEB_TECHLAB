                        <h2>About Our Goats</h2>
                            <p>The native goat breeds of Tamil Nadu, such as Kanni Adu and Salem Black, are known for their resilience and adaptability. These goats are well-suited for meat and milk production, thriving in diverse climatic conditions. With a compact yet strong body structure, they are naturally disease-resistant and require minimal maintenance.</p>
                            <p>Our goats are raised in a free-range environment, allowing them to graze naturally and maintain optimal health. They are provided with a balanced diet of organic fodder, ensuring high-quality milk and meat production.</p>

                        <h2>Our Farming Practices</h2>
                            <p>At RBR Farms, we follow sustainable and ethical goat farming practices. Our goats graze on natural pastures, promoting their well-being while ensuring an eco-friendly approach to livestock farming. We avoid the use of synthetic hormones or antibiotics, focusing instead on organic nutrition and traditional care.</p>
                            <p>We also preserve age-old farming techniques such as rotational grazing, which allows pastures to regenerate naturally and provides the goats with fresh, nutrient-rich forage. Our commitment to sustainability ensures that our farming methods are both environmentally friendly and beneficial to the animals.</p>
