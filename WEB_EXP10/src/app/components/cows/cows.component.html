                        <h2>About Our Cows</h2>
                        <p>The Kangayam breed is renowned for its strength and agility. These medium-sized cattle are perfect for draught purposes and are known for their compact body structure and robust hooves. With a height of 125–140 cm and a weight ranging from 340–525 kg, Kangayam cows are a symbol of endurance and vitality.</p>
                        <p>Our cows are raised in a stress-free environment, ensuring they remain healthy and productive. They are fed a balanced diet, which contributes to their overall well-being and the quality of milk they produce.</p>
